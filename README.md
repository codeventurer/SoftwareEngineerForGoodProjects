# SoftwareEngineerForGoodProjects

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.2.0.
It uses two way binding on some fields.  It connects to the global giving api and consumes and parses the data.  If I had more time, I would have added additional error handling and validation.  I would have added autocommplete on fields like iso country code.  I would have styled the application more and added additional videos, images, project data, searches and pagination.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
